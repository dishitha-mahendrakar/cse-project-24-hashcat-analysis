## Common Learning Outcomes

- Build real-world cyber security tools using Python  
- Capture and analyze real network traffic and logs  
- Develop GUI dashboards for security monitoring  
- Design simple self-learning rule engines  
- Understand cryptography, forensics, blockchain, DNS & packet analysis  

---

## Project Overview

### Concept
A controlled environment to study how password cracking tools operate and how rule sets affect cracking speed and success.

---

### Inputs
- Password hashes generated by students using secure hash algorithms such as **SHA-256** or **bcrypt**
- Custom dictionaries and mutation rule files designed by each student
- Hashcat configuration parameters such as attack mode and GPU/CPU options

---

### Outputs
- Cracking reports listing which hashes were cracked and in how much time
- Heatmap-style visualisation of which word patterns were most vulnerable
- Summary comparing effectiveness of different mutation rules

---

### Main Modules
- **Hash Generator** – Produces test hashes from known passwords  
- **Rule Designer** – Defines mutation strategies (append digits, leetspeak, etc.)  
- **Result Importer** – Parses Hashcat output  
- **Visualization Module** – Generates success-rate charts  
- **Guided Report Generator** – Summarises findings  

---

### Learning Component
Each student designs unique rule sets and uses their own hashes, keeping the lab ethical and AI-proof while demonstrating real attack mechanics.

---

### Use Case / Purpose
Demonstrates why strong password policies and salting are essential for cyber security defence.
