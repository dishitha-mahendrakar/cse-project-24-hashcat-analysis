## Project 24: Advanced Password Cracking Analysis Lab using Hashcat

### Concept
A controlled environment to study how password cracking tools operate and how rule sets affect cracking speed and success.

---

### Inputs
- Password hashes generated by students using secure hash algorithms such as **SHA-256** or **bcrypt**  
- Custom dictionaries and mutation rule files designed by each student  
- Hashcat configuration parameters such as attack mode and GPU/CPU options  

---

### Outputs
- Cracking reports listing which hashes were cracked and in how much time  
- Heatmap-style visualisation of which word patterns were most vulnerable  
- Summary comparing effectiveness of different mutation rules  

---

### Main Modules
- **Hash Generator** for producing test hashes from known passwords  
- **Rule Designer** where students specify mutation strategies (append digits, leetspeak, etc.)  
- **Result Importer** that parses Hashcat output  
- **Visualization Module** generating charts of success rate vs. rule set  
- **Guided Report Generator** summarising findings  

---

### Learning Component
Because each student designs unique rule sets and uses their own hashes, the lab stays ethical  
and AI-proof while teaching real attack mechanics.

---

### Use Case / Purpose
Useful for illustrating why strong password policies and salting are critical for defence.
