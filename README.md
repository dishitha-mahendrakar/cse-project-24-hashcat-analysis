# 🔐 Advanced Password Cracking Analysis Lab using Hashcat

## Cyber Security Essentials – Mini Project (Project 24)  
**Department of Computer Science & Engineering, PES University**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **controlled and ethical password cracking analysis laboratory** using **Hashcat**, a **custom rule-based mutation engine**, and a **self-built graphical user interface (GUI)** developed using **React (frontend)** and **FastAPI (backend)**.

The goal of the project is **not hacking**, but to **understand password vulnerabilities** and demonstrate **defensive cybersecurity principles** by analyzing:

- How password cracking tools operate  
- How mutation rules affect cracking speed and success  
- Why strong hashing and salting are critical for defense  

All experiments are performed **only on self-generated password hashes**, ensuring **ethical and academic compliance**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Weak and predictable passwords remain one of the leading causes of security breaches.  
Attackers exploit **human password patterns**, not randomness.

This project studies:

- Which password structures are most vulnerable  
- Why rule-based attacks outperform brute-force attacks  
- How modern hashing algorithms resist attacks  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a real-world cyber security tool using **Python and React**
- Design a **custom password mutation rule engine**
- Execute and monitor **Hashcat** in real time
- Visualize password vulnerability patterns
- Derive practical **defensive security insights**
